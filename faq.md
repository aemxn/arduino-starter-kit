# Electronics FAQ

1. How to easily determine resistor (and other components) voltage?

    > - Multimeter
    > - Its color code

2. Does each components serve different purpose? A servo: for motorize things, LED: for lighting things and as indicator, etc

3. Best practice for jumper wires management?

4. How does the circuit board electric current flows? Horizontally, vertically? How does the PCB board work then?

4. How much voltage and ampere does Uno R3 accepts?

5. WHat is positive-central 2.1mm barrel plug means?

6. Logic levels - logic high, logic low? What the fuck is that? (eg. 3.3V is logic HIGH for ESP8266)

7. Hey just wanted to ask, as a beginner to electronics and breadboard, what is the difference between plugging in an ESP pins in the middle of the breadboard (like the one you did above), and just leave the pins straight and plug it in directly at the one side of the board (http://imgur.com/a/i0c3k)?
